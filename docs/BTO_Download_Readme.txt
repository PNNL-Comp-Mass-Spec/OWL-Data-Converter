Download bto.owl from:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/bto

Convert using OWLDataConverter.exe


Also tried to convert with OBO-Edit and Protege, but conversion failed.

Steps tried for OBO-Edit
1) Start OBO-Edit
2) Choose File->Load Ontologies
3) Change Data adapter to "OBO Owl Adapter"
4) Select bto.owl
5) Click OK
6) Complains of a formatting error

Steps tried for Protege
1) Double click run.bat at C:\Program Files\Protoge to start Protoge
2) Choose File->Open and select bto.owl
3) Choose File->Save As
4) Select format bto and define a filename
5) The exporter freezes

Note that exporting to the turtle owl format worked just fine for Protoge
